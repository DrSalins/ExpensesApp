# ExpensesApp

The Expenses App is a website that will allow you to add your expenses through an input field and then will appear on the webpage with the item you bought and also the cost. It will start by asking you to add in your income, and from there you can add your expenses. It will alert you when your income is at 50% and ask you to save! I created this in order to track my expenditure, there are a lot of improvements I would like to make as this is my first iteration.
